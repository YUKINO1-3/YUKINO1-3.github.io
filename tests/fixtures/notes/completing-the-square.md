Starting with $x^2 + 6x$, arrange one square of side $x$ and two rectangles of dimensions $x$ by $3$. Adding the missing square of side $3$ completes the larger square:

$$
x^2 + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)^2.
$$

A small function can expose the vertex's horizontal coordinate:

```ts
function vertexX(a: number, b: number) {
  return -b / (2 * a);
}
```
